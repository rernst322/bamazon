#Bamazon

In this project I was tasked to make an online store called Bamazon. 

##Bamazon needs


##How it works
Starting the application would show a list of items avaliable for purchase. The user would then be prompted to choose one item from the list. Once chosen the suer would be then promoted to select a quanitity. If the quantity was larger than the items stock value, it would return 'Insufficient Quantity'. If the quantity was below or equal to the stock value it would log the amount of item chosen, the item, and the total.
